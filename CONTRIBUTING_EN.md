| style    | Changes to the format class of the code, like using `gofmt` to format codes, delete the blank lines, etc.        |
| refactor | Changes to other classes of the code, which do not belong to feat、fix、perf and style, like simplifying code, renaming variables, removing redundant code, etc. |
| test     | Add test cases or update existing test cases                            |
| ci       | Changes to continuous integration and continuous deployment, like modifying Ci configuration files such as jenkins and GitLab CI or updating systemd unit files. |

`scope` is used to illustrate the scope of the impact of commit, scope is as follows:

- cmd
- cnosql
- common
- db
- meta
- parser
- pkg
- query
- server
- \*

`description` is the short description of commit, which is specified not to exceed 72 characters.
#### Body

> Body is a detailed description of this commit, which can be divided into multiple lines.
>
> Notes:
>
> -   Use the first person and present tense, like using change instead of changed or changes.
> -   Describe the motivations for code changes in detail and the comparison of before and after behavior


#### Footer

> If the current code is not compatible with the previous version, the Footer section begins with BREAKING CHANGE, which is followed by a description of the changes, as well as the reasons for the changes and the method of migration.
> 
> Close Issue, if the current commit is for an issue, you can close the issue in the Footer section

```
Closes #1234,#2345

```

#### Revert

>In addition to the Header, Body, and Footer, Commit Message has a special case: If the current commit restores a previous commit, it should start with revert:, which is followed by a header of a restored commit. Besides, it must be written as This reverts commit  in the Body. Among them, hash is the SHA identity of the commit to be restored. For example：

```
revert: feat(core): add 'Host' option

This reverts commit 079360c7cfc830ea8a6e13f4c8b8114febc9b48a.
```
