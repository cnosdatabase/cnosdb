CnosDB is An Open Source Distributed Time Series Database with high performance, high compression ratio and high
usability.

CnosDB Isipho is an original new version of CnosDB which use Rust, [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/)
and [DataFusion](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion) to build.

## Design Objectives of CnosDB Isipho

To design and develop a high performance, high compression ratio, highly available, distributed cloud native time series
database, which meets the following objectives.

### Storage

- Separate storage and computation; theoretically uncapped support time series expansion; support horizontal/vertical
  scaling.
- Focus performance and cost balance; high performance io, Run-to-Completion scheduling model, support for hierarchical
  storage using object storage.
- Lossy compression with reduced precision at the user's option.

### Query

- Implemented query engine by using Apache Arrow and Datafusion.
- Support for vectorized execution of the query engine to execute complex query statements.
- Support for standard SQL, Flux, rich aggregate queries and arithmetic.

### Ecology

- Design for multi-tenant-oriented, providing more configuration parameters, able to provide more flexible configuration
  of resources.
- CDC, WAL can provide subscription and distribution to other nodes, more flexible deploy and support.
- Support Ecological compatibility with the K8s ecosystem, reducing shared memory.
- Integration with other data ecosystems to support import/export of parquet files.
- Be compatible with major international and domestic public cloud ecosystems.
